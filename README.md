This is a first approach to SAP Fiori 3.0 with React.js. 
For this I have chosen re-design user account of Paypal and develop an application with fiori-fundamentals framework.

Demo:</br>

## Goals
- Learn how to work in SAP Fiori 3.0 with react.js
- Create a custom theme with fiori fundamentals framework


## Disclaimer
- **This application isn't an official Paypal application**.
- **I'm not working for Paypal or receiving money of them**. 

*I'm doing this as example just to learn more about [fiori-fundamentals](https://sap.github.io/fundamental/) framework.*
